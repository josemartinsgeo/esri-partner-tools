# ArcGIS Client Server

> Modular ArcGIS POCs with React components and Flask blueprints

## About

These POCs showcase practical and cool workflows for building applications with ArcGIS. Each POC has a corresponding React component and/or Flask blueprint. The POCs are then composed together in a [client app](/client_server/client) and a separate [server API](/client_server/server).

In addition, I've found this to be an awesome way to learn about new libraries, including [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) || [arcgis-rest-js](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/) || [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) || [React](https://reactjs.org/) || [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)...

### App ([component](/client_server/client/src/App.js))

> Simple [browser-based](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/security-and-authentication/browser-based-user-logins/) OAuth2.0 with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [arcgis-rest-js](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/)

**NOTE** You'll likely have to roll in [server-based](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/security-and-authentication/security-and-usage-concerns/) login, a user-management system, etc.
